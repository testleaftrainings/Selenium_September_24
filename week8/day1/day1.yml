Steps to Integrate Extent Report with POM:
---------------------------------
1. Create startReport() with @BeforeSuite in BaseClass or PSM and copy  step1 to step3 code from extent report
2. Make ExtentReports as global  and static variable
3. Create stopReport() with @AfterSuite to have extent.flush()
4. Create testDetails() with @BeforeClass for test case details code
5. Declare ExtentTest test as global and static variable
6. Create 4 global variables testName, testDescription, testAuthor and testCategory
7. Relace the hardcoded values with the respective variable names
8. Assign the values for the variables in the setValues() in the testcases    @BeforeTest 
9. Create reportStep(String stepDetails, String status) in the PSM with conditional implementation for pass / fail
10. methods in pages should have try / catch implementation
11. call the reportStep() with pass status from try block & with pass and fail status
